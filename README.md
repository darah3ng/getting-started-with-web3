## Getting started with Web3

`To Lethal üëã,`

I hope this md finds you well. I'm gonna try my best to simplify the guide so you get too overwhelmed by the resources.

Keep in mind that this docs is very opiniated, so I encourage you to explore to find the ones that suit you.

Since I like learning backwards, this is the order on how I would start:

## Solidity courses
- [Cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en/course)
  - The first 3 courses should help you understand the Solidity concepts and syntax
- [Fullstack video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0osIaAOFSE)
  - It walks you through the basic use of React.JS, Ethers.JS, Solidity, Hardhat, and Infura
- [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so/)
  - Complete this course: "Build a Web3 App with Solidity + Ethereum Smart Contracts"

```
üí° Once you've done one of the courses, you should now be curious enough to check out the information below.

## Frontend
- npm or yarn
  - [what is npm?](https://medium.com/swlh/what-is-npm-a-simple-english-guide-to-truly-understanding-the-node-package-manager-41e82f6c5515)
- React.JS
  - [React crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8)

## Solidity docs
- [Solidity by example](https://solidity-by-example.org/)
  - Definitely very helpful to understand its syntax and concepts
  - A good combo with this is to play around with the example using `Remix` which I mentioned below.
- [Offical Ethereum Docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/)
  - This page has everything you need to learn about Etheruem and more. The resources are tremendous.

## Dev suite

### Remix ‚öôÔ∏è
This is very good if you don't wanna do any setup on your local env. Super quick for you to get started with developing, testing and deploying.
- [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- [How to use Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZKVfXmzRDw)

### Hardhat üë∑
A popular dev enviroment.
- https://hardhat.org/getting-started/

### Alchemy üîÆ
A web3 developemt suite where people mainly use it to deploy their contracts into the blockchain for both testnet and mainnet.
- https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/

An alternative platform is [Infura](https://infura.io/).
